# Buffalo-Crime-Rate


This project aims to analyze the crime patterns in the city of Buffalo, New York. The dataset was
collected from Open Data Buffalo, (Buffaloâ€™s official open data program that makes public
information publicly available). This dataset is updated daily and offers a preliminary look at crime
reports in the City of Buffalo. We extracted the data using Socrata Open Data API. The consumed
data was then stored in a csv file, from which the data was ingested in database using SQLite. EDA
was then performed on the data to find underlying patterns, and visualized using various Python
libraries. Finally, predictions were made to categorize if a certain type of incident is a
Larceny/Theft or not.
